# üîß 1.1 Overview of Freqtrade Architecture

Freqtrade is a powerful, open-source cryptocurrency trading bot written in Python. It empowers developers and traders to create, test, and deploy automated trading strategies on crypto markets. Its modular architecture is what makes it flexible, scalable, and developer-friendly.

## üìê Core Components of Freqtrade

### ‚úÖ Strategy Development
At the heart of Freqtrade is the **strategy file**, where users define trading logic using Python. You write when to buy, when to sell, and optionally when to use stoploss or exit signals. You can use any indicator (like RSI, Bollinger Bands, MACD) or create your own logic using pandas and TA libraries.

The strategy is just a Python class extending `IStrategy`, with methods like:
- `populate_indicators()`
- `populate_entry_trend()`
- `populate_exit_trend()`

### ‚úÖ Backtesting Engine
Freqtrade lets you **backtest** your strategy using historical data, simulating how it would‚Äôve performed in the past. This helps:
- Validate your strategy logic
- Compare performance across coins
- Avoid blindly trusting a new idea

You run:
```bash
freqtrade backtesting --strategy MyStrategy
```

And get reports with metrics like:
- Sharpe Ratio
- Drawdown
- Win rate
- Trade count

### ‚úÖ Hyperparameter Optimization (Hyperopt)
Hyperopt allows you to **tune your strategy‚Äôs parameters** (like RSI thresholds or ROI targets) for best performance. Freqtrade uses a search algorithm to find the combination that gives the best result.

Hyperopt modules:
- Buy/sell logic
- Stoploss tuning
- ROI optimization

CLI example:
```bash
freqtrade hyperopt --spaces all --strategy MyStrategy
```

### ‚úÖ Live / Dry / Simulated Trading
You can run your bot:
- **Live**: With real funds on a real exchange.
- **Dry-run**: Simulated, tracks trades without spending money.
- **Backtest**: Using historical data only.

Freqtrade connects to exchanges via [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt), an open-source library that supports Binance, KuCoin, Bybit, and others.

Example:
```bash
freqtrade trade --config config.json
```

### ‚úÖ Risk Management & Protections
Freqtrade includes built-in **risk management tools**:
- Static or trailing stoploss
- ROI targets
- Cooldown periods between trades
- Position size limits
- Leverage settings (for Futures)

You can even build **custom protections**, like:
- Don‚Äôt trade during high volatility
- Limit max trades per day

## üîó How Strategies Fit into the Bigger Picture

Your strategy is just one part of the system ‚Äî but it defines how the bot behaves. Think of it as the brain of the bot.

### üß† What a Strategy Does
Your strategy class is responsible for:
- Deciding **when to enter** a position (long/short)
- Defining **exit signals**, ROI, and stoploss behavior
- Optionally using machine learning predictions (`freqai_predictions`)
- Configuring risk parameters like:
  ```python
  minimal_roi = { "0": 0.1 }
  stoploss = -0.05
  trailing_stop = True
  ```

### üîÅ What It Connects To

| Component | Role |
|----------|------|
| **CCXT (Exchange Adapter)** | Connects Freqtrade to Binance, KuCoin, etc. |
| **Download-data** | Provides historical OHLCV data for backtesting |
| **Trade Management Engine** | Handles order placement, wallet tracking, trade lifecycle |
| **Protection Engine** | Applies risk rules like cooldowns, max pairs, etc. |
| **Hyperopt Engine** | Optimizes your strategy by searching parameter space |
| **FreqAI (optional)** | Adds machine learning predictions into strategy logic |

### üì¶ Strategy Lifecycle in Action

1. **Bot runs**: Freqtrade starts, reads config and loads your strategy class.
2. **Candle data flows**: Every new candle, your `populate_indicators()` runs.
3. **Entry check**: If entry conditions are met, a trade is placed.
4. **Exit check**: Your exit logic (or stoploss/ROI) closes the trade.
5. **Trade is recorded**: Trades are logged and statistics updated.

## ‚úÖ Summary

Freqtrade isn‚Äôt just a strategy runner. It‚Äôs a full trading **framework** that includes:
- A plug-and-play interface for Python strategies
- A backtesting and optimization toolkit
- Real and simulated trading support
- Strong integration with exchanges and risk controls

Your job as a developer is to write smart strategies ‚Äî Freqtrade handles everything else.
