# 📘 1.2 Understanding Strategy Skeleton

In this lesson, you’ll explore the **skeleton of a Freqtrade strategy**. Every strategy inherits from the `IStrategy` base class and includes key attributes and methods that control its behavior.

---

## 🧱 Basic Strategy Template

```python
from freqtrade.strategy import IStrategy
from pandas import DataFrame

class MyStrategy(IStrategy):
    INTERFACE_VERSION = 3
    timeframe = '5m'
    can_short = False

    minimal_roi = {
        "0": 0.1  # Take 10% profit immediately if possible
    }

    stoploss = -0.3  # Stop loss at -30%
    trailing_stop = True  # Enable dynamic trailing stop

    process_only_new_candles = True
    startup_candle_count: int = 30

    use_exit_signal = True
    exit_profit_only = True
    ignore_roi_if_entry_signal = True

    def populate_indicators(self, dataframe: DataFrame, metadata: dict) -> DataFrame:
        return dataframe

    def populate_entry_trend(self, dataframe: DataFrame, metadata: dict) -> DataFrame:
        return dataframe

    def populate_exit_trend(self, dataframe: DataFrame, metadata: dict) -> DataFrame:
        return dataframe
```

## 🔍 Detailed Explanation of Key Attributes

### 🔢 `INTERFACE_VERSION`
Defines the version of Freqtrade’s strategy interface your strategy conforms to. Always use the latest (currently `3`) unless you know otherwise.

```python
INTERFACE_VERSION = 3
```

---

### ⏱ `timeframe`
Specifies the candle resolution (like `'5m'`, `'1h'`, `'1d'`) that your strategy uses. This timeframe determines:
- The granularity of signals
- Which data is passed into `populate_*` methods

```python
timeframe = '5m'
```

---

### 📉 `can_short`
If set to `True`, allows your strategy to place short (sell-first, buy-later) orders — supported only on futures-capable exchanges like Binance Futures.

```python
can_short = True  # or False for spot trading only
```

---

### 📈 `minimal_roi`
Defines **return on investment (ROI)** targets — a dictionary where:
- The key = minutes since the trade was opened
- The value = minimum profit to exit the trade

```python
minimal_roi = {
    "0": 0.1,   # 10% ROI from minute 0
    "30": 0.05, # 5% ROI after 30 minutes
    "60": 0.02  # 2% after 1 hour
}
```

> This logic lets you define dynamic expectations — more aggressive early exits, more patient later on.

---

### 🛑 `stoploss`
Defines the **maximum allowed loss** for a trade. When reached, the bot exits the position. Can be combined with trailing stop for dynamic control.

```python
stoploss = -0.3  # Cut losses at -30%
```

---

### 🌀 `trailing_stop`
Enables **dynamic stoploss** movement. When price rises, the stoploss is moved upward to secure profits.

```python
trailing_stop = True
```

You can also customize these:
```python
trailing_stop_positive = 0.02
trailing_stop_positive_offset = 0.03
```

---

### 🔄 `process_only_new_candles`
If `True`, your strategy processes signals **once per new candle**. Avoids multiple entries in the same candle and improves speed.

```python
process_only_new_candles = True
```

> Useful for high-frequency strategies on small timeframes.

---

### 🕓 `startup_candle_count`
Defines how many candles are required before your strategy becomes active. This is important for indicators like RSI, SMA, or Bollinger Bands that require a history to compute.

```python
startup_candle_count: int = 30
```

---

### 🚪 `use_exit_signal`
Allows custom exit logic in `populate_exit_trend()`. If set to `False`, Freqtrade will only use ROI/stoploss to exit trades.

```python
use_exit_signal = True
```

---

### 💰 `exit_profit_only`
Prevents your exit logic from triggering if the trade is not yet in profit.

```python
exit_profit_only = True
```

---

### ⚡ `ignore_roi_if_entry_signal`
If a new **entry signal** appears while a trade is already open, this option lets the bot close the current trade **before ROI is reached**, making room for a potentially better setup.

```python
ignore_roi_if_entry_signal = True
```

---

## 🧠 What This All Means

Together, these parameters define how your strategy behaves:
- **When to trade**
- **When to take profit or stop loss**
- **How aggressive or conservative your risk behavior is**

Understanding and fine-tuning these is the **first step to building a profitable strategy**.
