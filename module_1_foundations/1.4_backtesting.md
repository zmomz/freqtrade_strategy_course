# 📘 1.4 Backtesting Your First Strategy

After building your strategy logic, the next step is to **test how it performs on historical data** using Freqtrade’s backtesting engine. This module teaches you how to backtest your Bollinger Reversal strategy, interpret the results, and avoid common mistakes.

---

## 🧪 Running a Backtest

### ✅ Docker Version

If you're using Docker (recommended), you can run a backtest like this:

```bash
docker compose run --rm freqtrade backtesting \
  --config config.json \
  --strategy BollingerReversal
```

> Replace `BollingerReversal` with the name of your strategy class.

### 🧰 Optional Parameters

- `--timerange 20220101-20230101`  
  Test only a specific date range.
- `--export trades`  
  Export a CSV of individual trades.
- `--export summary`  
  Save summary report as JSON/CSV.

### ✅ Local (non-Docker) Example

If you're running locally (not in Docker):

```bash
freqtrade backtesting --config config.json --strategy BollingerReversal
```

## 📊 Understanding Backtest Results

After the backtest runs, you’ll see an output like:

```
2025-04-17 12:00:00 - Performance Report
----------------------------------------
Total trades: 104
Profitable trades: 45 (43.27%)
Unprofitable trades: 59 (56.73%)
Average profit: 1.75%
Average duration: 2h 12m

Sharpe ratio: 1.22
Profit factor: 1.45
Total profit: 0.156 BTC
```

Here’s what these key metrics mean:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Total Trades** | Number of trades opened by the strategy |
| **Profitable/Unprofitable Trades** | Winning vs losing trades (with percentage) |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Measures risk-adjusted return (higher = better) |
| **Profit Factor** | Gross profit / gross loss (should be > 1) |
| **Average Profit** | Mean return per trade |
| **Total Profit** | Net profit over backtested period |

> A Sharpe ratio above 1.0 and a profit factor above 1.2 is a good starting point for most strategies.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. 🧱 Forgetting `startup_candle_count`
If you reference indicators that need historical data (like Bollinger Bands or RSI), make sure your strategy has:

```python
startup_candle_count = 30
```

If not, your bot might start trading too early and fail due to missing data.

---

### 2. 🔮 Forward-Looking Bias
Never reference **future candles** in your logic (like using `shift(-1)` or `dataframe['close'].pct_change().shift(-1)`). It results in **unrealistically high profits** and poor real-world performance.

✅ Always base your entries and exits on data **from or before the current candle**.

---

### 3. 🚫 Unrealistic Stoploss / ROI Settings
Backtests can give false signals of profitability if you use:
- Stoplosses like `-0.9` (losing 90%)
- ROI targets like `{"0": 2.0}` (expecting +200% instantly)

Keep things realistic:
- Typical stoploss range: -0.01 to -0.10
- ROI: 0.01 to 0.10 depending on timeframe and volatility

---

### 4. 🎯 Overfitting to Small Datasets
A strategy that performs well on **one year and one coin** may fail in real trading.

✅ Always:
- Test on **multiple years**
- Use **at least 3–5 trading pairs**
- Compare performance across volatile and stable assets

---

## ✅ Quick Checklist Before You Move On

- [x] Can you run a backtest without errors?
- [x] Do you understand the key performance metrics?
- [x] Are your stoploss and ROI values reasonable?
- [x] Are you avoiding future leaks in your indicators?
- [x] Did you test on more than one pair or time range?
