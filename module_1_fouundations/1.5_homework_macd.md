## 🏠 1.5 Homework

### ✅ Task:
Research and build a basic strategy using **MACD**:
- Use `ta.MACD()` to generate signals
- Implement long entry when MACD crosses above signal
- Midline exit or ROI-based exit

Test this using the same backtesting process and review its metrics.

👉 You’ll improve this MACD strategy later in Module 2!
